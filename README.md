## Utility Scripts

### Cover Image Checker

The `scripts/check_covers.sh` script verifies that all cover images referenced in the music database actually exist in the project. It scans all JSON files across all language versions (de, en, es, fr, it) and reports any missing cover images.

Features:
- Checks all language versions simultaneously
- Avoids duplicate reports for the same missing cover
- Shows which JSON file references a missing cover
- Only displays missing covers (no output for existing covers)
- Provides a success message when all covers are present

Requirements:
- bash shell
- jq (JSON processor, install via `brew install jq`)

Usage:
```bash
cd scripts
./check_covers.sh
```

Example output:
```bash
üîç Searching for missing cover images...

‚ùå Missing cover: /bandcover/1950er/artist_album.jpg
   Referenced in: de/50er.json

‚úÖ All cover images are present!  # (when no covers are missing)
```

### Music Links Synchronization

The `scripts/sync_music_links.py` script helps maintain consistency across different language versions of the music database. It copies the following fields from the German version to other language versions:
- coverSrc
- spotify_link
- deezer_link
- apple_music_link
- preview_link

Features:
- Synchronizes links across all language versions (en, es, fr, it)
- Matches songs by artist and album name
- Only updates fields that are different or missing
- Shows detailed progress and changes made
- Preserves all other content in target files

Requirements:
- Python 3.x

Usage:
```bash
cd scripts
python3 sync_music_links.py
```

Example output:
```bash
Processing 50er.json

Updating /app/json/genres/en/50er.json
Updated entry: Miles Davis - Kind of Blue
Updated entry: Elvis Presley - Elvis Presley
Total entries updated in /app/json/genres/en/50er.json: 2

No changes needed for /app/json/genres/es/50er.json
```

### Preview Link Checker

The `scripts/check_preview_links.py` script verifies the accessibility of all preview audio links in the music database. It generates a detailed HTML report showing the status of each link across all language versions.

Features:
- Checks preview links across all language versions
- Automatic retries for failed requests with exponential backoff
- Service-specific handling for different streaming platforms (Apple Music, Deezer, Spotify)
- Detailed HTML report with:
  - Summary statistics
  - Service distribution
  - Detailed error information for inaccessible links
  - File locations for problematic entries
- Multi-threaded processing for faster checks
- Language filtering option

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (`sudo apt install python3-requests` on Ubuntu/Debian)

Usage:
```bash
# Check all languages
python3 scripts/check_preview_links.py

# Check specific languages
python3 scripts/check_preview_links.py --languages en de fr

# Customize retry behavior
python3 scripts/check_preview_links.py --retries 5 --retry-delay 2.0
```

The script generates an HTML report in the `reports` directory with a timestamp in the filename. The report includes:
- Total number of links checked
- Number of accessible and inaccessible links
- Distribution of links by streaming service
- Detailed information about any inaccessible links, including:
  - Artist and album information
  - URL and error details
  - File path where the link was found
  - Content type information
  - Retry attempt details
