## Utility Scripts

### Cover Image Checker

The `scripts/check_covers.sh` script verifies that all cover images referenced in the music database actually exist in the project. It scans all JSON files across all language versions (de, en, es, fr, it) and reports any missing cover images.

Features:
- Checks all language versions simultaneously
- Avoids duplicate reports for the same missing cover
- Shows which JSON file references a missing cover
- Only displays missing covers (no output for existing covers)
- Provides a success message when all covers are present

Requirements:
- bash shell
- jq (JSON processor, install via `brew install jq`)

Usage:
```bash
cd scripts
./check_covers.sh
```

Example output:
```bash
üîç Searching for missing cover images...

‚ùå Missing cover: /bandcover/1950er/artist_album.jpg
   Referenced in: de/50er.json

‚úÖ All cover images are present!  # (when no covers are missing)
```

### Music Links Synchronization

The `scripts/sync_music_links.py` script helps maintain consistency across different language versions of the music database. It copies the following fields from the German version to other language versions:
- coverSrc
- spotify_link
- deezer_link
- apple_music_link
- preview_link

Features:
- Synchronizes links across all language versions (en, es, fr, it)
- Matches songs by artist and album name
- Only updates fields that are different or missing
- Shows detailed progress and changes made
- Preserves all other content in target files

Requirements:
- Python 3.x

Usage:
```bash
cd scripts
python3 sync_music_links.py
```

Example output:
```bash
Processing 50er.json

Updating /app/json/genres/en/50er.json

Total entries updated in /app/json/genres/en/50er.json: 2
