## Introduction


The genre of House music stands as one of the most influential forms of electronic dance music (EDM). Emerging from the vibrant club culture of Chicago during the early 1980s, House music has evolved into a global phenomenon that transcends boundaries of culture, age, and geography. As a genre, it has infused itself into popular music, an array of social movements, and the very fabric of nightlife across the world. Characterized by its repetitive, hypnotic beats and synthesized melodies, House not only embodies the spirit of the dancefloor but also represents a unique blend of musical influences that speak to a community of diverse music lovers.

At its core, House music has been a vehicle of expression for marginalized artists, particularly within the LGBTQ+ community, celebrating freedom, diversity, and the joy of dance. This characteristic has become increasingly significant as the genre developed through the decades, gaining a distinct identity while simultaneously adapting to new influences. Nowadays, House is not just confined to clubs; it finds its place in festivals, radio stations, and even mainstream media, showcasing the flexibility and universality of its appeal.

Even as the sound of House continues to evolve, the foundational elements established in its formative years remain at the heart of its creation. Intertwined with socio-political narratives and the dance culture of its time, House music provides more than just entertainment; it serves as a reflection of society's ongoing dialogues. The rush of a four-on-the-floor beat, the echoing vocal samples, and the soaring synths are not just sound designs; they paint a sonic landscape filled with emotion, history, and a promise of belonging. As we explore the various facets of House music, we will dive deep into its historical background, musical characteristics, subgenres, key figures, cultural significance, performance culture, and its lasting legacy.


## Historical Background


House music's roots can be traced back to the late 1970s and early 1980s in Chicago, where a unique convergence of musical styles, technological advancements, and cultural environments led to its birth. Predominantly influenced by disco, soul, funk, and electronic music, the genre began to materialize in underground clubs and parties, where a group of DJs and producers sought to create a sound that was both innovative and deeply rooted in the dancefloor tradition. One prominent venue, the Warehouse, operated by David Mancuso's peer, inspired the genre's name, 'House,' as many of the genres played within its confines began transforming under a new sonic architecture.

DJs like Frankie Knuckles, Ron Hardy, and Larry Heard played pivotal roles in the proliferation of House music, experimenting with rhythm and harmony to elicit emotional responses from dancers. These pioneers pushed boundaries, mixing an array of styles such as European synth-pop and American funk, laying the groundwork for what would soon be recognized as the House sound. It is important to note that the genre's emergence was not just a musical revolution but also a socio-political one, giving voice to marginalized communities, especially the African American and LGBTQ+ populations, who found solace and expression in the incandescent glow of the dancefloor.

By the mid-1980s, House music had gained traction beyond Chicago, spreading to cities like New York and Detroit. The parallel movements of hip-hop and techno also interplayed within this era, showcasing a uniquely American fabric of electronic music that contributed to the evolution of House subgenres. The introduction of affordable production technologies, such as synthesizers and drum machines, further propelled the genre into the public consciousness, encouraging aspiring musicians to try their hands at producing tracks.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, House music became increasingly recognized internationally, particularly with the British rave scene embracing its pulsating beats. Artists and groups such as The KLF and Daft Punk made significant strides in integrating House into mainstream music, exploring new sounds and appealing to a broader audience. This transition into the commercial sphere marked a pivotal moment for House music, leading to its growth on an unprecedented scale. As the genre continued to morph through the '90s into the 2000s, new subgenres emerged, showcasing its adaptability to new influences and technologies.

This historical backdrop illustrates that House music is not just a sound; it is a cultural ethos shaped by historical moments, geographical movements, and collective energies of those who seek joy through dance. As we explore its musical characteristics in the following section, it becomes crucial to remember this context, giving layers of meaning to the rich tapestry that is House music.


## Musical Characteristics


House music is defined by its specific musical traits, which contribute to its infectious and danceable nature. The genre is characterized by a steady, four-on-the-floor rhythm, typically anchored in a 4/4 time signature. This structural consistency creates an inviting environment for dancing, embodying the collective experience that is a hallmark of the genre. Songs often kick off with a bass drum hitting on every beat, creating a robust foundation over which other elements effortlessly float.

Synthesizers play a significant role in crafting the soundscape of House music, contributing lush chord progressions and melodic hooks that elevate the track's emotional intensity. Synthesizers, along with drum machines such as the Roland TR-808 and TR-909, have become iconic within the genre, providing both a rhythmic backbone and melodic embellishment. The use of these electronic instruments distinguishes House music from other genres, creating a warm, enveloping sound that resonates on the dance floor.

Additionally, House music employs basslines that are often melodic and groovy, inviting listeners to engage physically with the rhythm. The bass guitar or synthesized bass can swing, offering a sense of movement that encourages dancing. Often syncopated, these basslines create a dynamic interplay with the drums, enhancing the groove and ensuring that the listener remains engaged throughout the track. The interplay of rhythm and melody is essential in House, providing layers that keep the listener's interest alive.

Vocal samples and full vocals are also hallmarks of House music. Often drawing from soul, funk, and disco influences, these vocal elements serve as both a hook and a means of emotional connection. The use of repetitive phrases, both sampled and original, creates an almost mantra-like quality in many House tracks. This repetition is a critical aspect of House, allowing the music to build and evolve throughout its duration while creating moments for dance.

Furthermore, the tempo of House music typically falls within the range of 120 to 130 beats per minute (BPM), striking a balance that facilitates both ecstatic dancing and a controlled listening experience. This tempo is often flexible, allowing various subgenres to experiment while maintaining the core rhythmic identity associated with House. The aesthetic employed also tends to lean towards a polished, produced sound, benefiting from advances in technology and studio techniques.

Ultimately, the musical characteristics of House music create a rich tapestry of sound that invites participation. Its rhythm, harmony, and overall sound design are a collective product of influences that span multiple decades, genres, and cultural moments. In understanding these characteristics, we can more deeply appreciate the numerous subgenres and variations that have emerged, as explored in the following section.


## Subgenres and Variations


House music has garnered a rich array of subgenres and variations, each contributing to the overarching sound while introducing distinctive elements and influences. These variations reflect the genre's adaptability and its ability to respond to shifting cultural landscapes, allowing House music to appeal to diverse audiences. From classic styles to contemporary interpretations, the evolution of House music has been marked by the emergence of several notable subgenres.

One of the earliest and most influential subgenres is Deep House. Emerging in the mid-1980s, Deep House is characterized by its smooth, jazzy elements and complex chord progressions. It often incorporates soulful vocals, emphasizing emotional expression and creative arrangements. Pioneers like Larry Heard and Masters At Work were instrumental in defining this style. Deep House is often slower, typically ranging from 110 to 125 BPM, creating a relaxed ambiance on the dancefloor while still inviting movement.

Another significant variation is Acid House, which originated in Chicago's club scene but quickly spread to the UK by the late '80s. Defined by the use of the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, Acid House features squelchy basslines and psychedelic elements that evoke a trance-like state. The genre's aesthetic was closely tied to the rave culture that proliferated during this time, promoting a sense of liberation and exploration. Artists like Phuture and DJ Pierre are credited with shaping Acid House’s sonic contours, lending the genre an unforgettable identity.

In contrast, Progressive House emerged in the early '90s as a more melodic and atmospheric take on the genre. Characterized by longer track lengths and gradual builds, Progressive House often features sweeping synth pads and uplifting breakdowns that create an emotional journey. This subgenre has gained immense popularity in the dance music scene, with artists like Sasha and John Digweed at the forefront, representing the compelling fusion of electronic music with an immersive experience.

Tech House emerged in the 2000s, melding the sounds of Techno and House. This subgenre combines the percussive elements of Techno with the groove-oriented aspects of House, resulting in a sound that emphasizes rhythm and minimalism. It often features stripped-back production, allowing for intricate layering of drum patterns and subtle melodies. Labels like Crosstown Rebels and artists such as Jamie Jones and Seth Troxler have played pivotal roles in the popularization of Tech House, steering it into club culture across the globe.

Another notable variation is Future House, which gained traction in the 2010s. Melding elements from various electronic genres, Future House is known for its bass-heavy drops and melodic leads. Characterized by its use of vocal chops and an energetic feel, Future House represents a contemporary take on traditional House. Producers like Tchami and Oliver Heldens have become well-known figures within the subgenre, elevating its profile within the modern electronic scene.

Furthermore, a strong influence has also emerged from regional sounds, such as Afro House and Latin House. Afro House integrates African rhythms and instruments, often featuring complex percussive elements and incorporating traditional vocal styles. Latin House, on the other hand, draws upon Latin American musical styles, incorporating vibrant rhythms and danceable grooves. These regional variations illustrate how House music has evolved to remain relevant in diverse cultural contexts, engaging audiences worldwide.

In examining the vast array of House music's subgenres and variations, it is evident that the genre's elastic nature plays a pivotal role in its ongoing evolution. Each subgenre not only retains the characteristic foundational elements of House but also evolves to reflect the influences of contemporary sounds and cultural narratives. This adaptability ensures that House music means different things to various listeners, forging connections across a multitude of experiences and backgrounds. The following section will delve into the key figures and important works that have defined House music throughout its history.


## Key Figures and Important Works


The landscape of House music is illuminated by a constellation of influential artists and seminal works that have shaped the genre's evolution. Emerging from the underground club scene in Chicago, these key figures have contributed not only to the sound but also to the culture surrounding House music, leaving an indelible mark on its history.

Frankie Knuckles, often referred to as the "Godfather of House," is perhaps the most pivotal figure in the genre’s ascent. In the 1980s, he established foundational tracks like "Your Love" (with Jamie Principle) and "Baby Wants to Ride," both of which helped define the House sound with deep grooves and emotionally resonant vocals. Knuckles' work at the Warehouse, where he played an eclectic mix of tracks, helped cement House music's identity while uniting diverse groups on the dancefloor.

Another essential figure is Larry Heard, also known as Mr. Fingers. Heard's tracks, such as "Can You Feel It" and "Washing Machine," contributed to the Deep House subgenre, characterized by intricate melodies and lush harmonies. His music infused elements of jazz and soul, establishing a contemplative yet danceable atmosphere that elevated the emotional quality of House music.

The Chicago scene was also fertile ground for a multitude of influential producers, such as Marshall Jefferson, whose track "Move Your Body" is often celebrated as one of the defining anthems of House music. Through catchy hooks and uplifting melodies, Jefferson helped spread the gospel of House beyond the club scene, leading to newfound popularity. His collaborations and productions captured the spirit of House, showcasing its ability to evoke joy and connection on the dancefloor.

In New York, the emergence of Tony Humphries and his work as a remixer contributed significantly to the genre's growth. His remixes of tracks like "Let’s Groove" by George Benson injected House energy into popular songs, fortifying connections between the genre and mainstream music. Humphries' role in clubs like Zanzibar helped promote House’s narrative within the larger cultural landscape.

The UK also played a crucial role in the maturation of House music during the late 1980s. Artists such as Ian Pooley and the duo of Sasha and John Digweed became instrumental figures in creating a distinctly British variation of House. Their mixed sets exemplified the Progressive House movement, showcasing the genre's atmosphere, depth, and complexity, elevating it to the status of an art form.

As House music evolved through the 1990s and into the 2000s, new voices emerged. Daft Punk, with their unique blend of House beats and elements of disco and funk, ushered in a new era for the genre. Their albums "Homework" and "Discovery" celebrated the dance aspect of House while exploring broader musical territory. Tracks like "One More Time" and "Around the World" became chart-topping hits that showcased the genre’s capacity for crossover appeal, further solidifying House’s place within mainstream music.

Artists like Kerri Chandler and Armand Van Helden also emerged as influential producers in the evolution of House. Chandler's tracks emphasized the use of deep, house chords and intricate percussion elements, while Van Helden's hits, including "The Funk Phenomena," contributed to further diversifying the subgenre’s reach and influence.

As we consider the continuing development of House, it is essential to recognize the contributions of contemporary figures such as Derrick Carter, Dennis Ferrer, and Purple Disco Machine. Each artist continues to innovate while respecting House music’s fundamentals, expanding the genre with new influences and sounds. Tracks like Carter's "Angular" and Ferrer’s "Hey Hey" echo the emotional resonance and danceable energy that define House to this day.

As House music has grown over the decades, it has been molded by passionate practitioners who have pushed the boundaries of the genre while remaining firmly entrenched in its essence. Each artist and their notable works reveal the intricate canvas that is House music, richly woven with influences, emotions, and technical mastery. Understanding the pivotal figures in this genre deepens our appreciation for the cultural narratives interwoven within House, which will be further explored in the subsequent technical aspects of its production.


## Technical Aspects


Examining the technical aspects of House music introduces us to the intricate tools and techniques that give rise to its signature sound. These components have evolved synchronously with the genre, utilising advances in technology while embedding musical creativity. The fusion of hardware, software, and production methodologies represents the backbone of House music's growth and popularity.

At its inception, House music was birthed from analog equipment. Relying heavily on synthesizers, drum machines, and samplers, early producers created a distinctive sound that defined the genre. The Roland TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines, in particular, became iconic tools within the genre, helping to craft the punchy kick drums and snappy snares that are hallmarks of House tracks. The use of these devices not only defined the rhythm but also contributed to the overall sonic texture, allowing for a rich and enveloping auditory experience.

Synthesizers, such as the Roland Juno-106 and Korg PolySix, played a vital role in developing House music’s melodic elements. Producers could create lush pads, compelling basslines, and intricate leads that added depth to their music. The warm analog tones provided by these synths became essential in crafting the genre's emotive qualities, serving as conduits for expression on the dancefloor.

Sampling also became a fundamental aspect of House production. Early producers utilized samples from funk, disco, and soul records, snatching vocal snippets or notable instrumental hooks to weave into their compositions. This connection to the past imbued House music with a sense of nostalgia while fostering a dialogue between different musical eras. The use of pitched-down vocal samples, rhythmic chops, and looped elements created a texture that became synonymous with the House sound.

In the 1990s and beyond, the advent of digital audio workstations (DAWs) allowed for a significant evolution in House music production. Software programs like Ableton Live, FL Studio, and Logic Pro have enabled both amateur and professional producers to craft complex compositions from their own studios, eliminating geographical constraints. The accessibility of these tools has contributed to a democratic approach to music production, allowing a broader range of voices to contribute to the genre.

Aside from the technological advancements, the techniques employed in the production of House songs also showcase the genre's depth. Producers often build tracks around a central groove, layering elements methodically to create dynamic arrangements that develop over time. Common techniques include filter sweeps, modulation, and sidechain compression, each harnessing sonic manipulation to craft immersive auditory experiences.

The mixing process itself requires skill and precision, as the need to balance various elements—from basslines to percussion and vocal samples—is paramount. Equalization (EQ), compression, and reverb are often employed to create space within the mix, ensuring that each element is articulated without overwhelming the overall sound. Additionally, transitions between sections maintain the energy and flow essential to dance music, often utilizing build-ups, drops, and breakdowns to elicit emotional responses from the listener.

Finally, live performance techniques have been influenced significantly by the technical aspects of House music. DJing, often viewed as a performance art form within the genre, embraces seamless transitions and creative mixing of tracks to build a continuous, energetic flow. Artists utilize turntables, digital controllers, and software to craft dynamic performances, drawing from a range of House tracks to create unique sonic experiences during live sets.

The technical aspects of House music are as versatile as they are intricate, revealing the deep layers embedded within the genre's sound. Examining the tools and methodologies of production elucidates the craftsmanship that goes into each —a tapestry of technology where artistic expression flourishes. This technical mastery has profound implications for the cultural significance of House, a topic we will explore in detail in the following section.


## Cultural Significance


House music's cultural significance extends far beyond its infectious rhythms and catchy melodies; it embodies a rich tapestry of social movements, identity, and communal experiences. Emerging from the underground scene in Chicago, House became an anthem for marginalized communities, particularly the African-American and LGBTQ+ populations, who found refuge in its pulsating beats. This connection establishes House music as more than just a musical genre; it serves as a vessel for identity, representation, and community building.

During its inception in the early 1980s, House music represented a form of escapism for individuals seeking solace from societal pressures. The vibrance of the dancefloor provided a sanctuary where people could celebrate their identities without the judgments present in everyday life. As a genre that famously promotes inclusivity and acceptance, House embodies the ethos of joy, freedom, and self-expression. This powerful message resonated deeply with audiences, sparking connections among diverse groups of people from various backgrounds.

Moreover, House music emerged in a crucial period for the LGBTQ+ community. During the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the dancefloor became a reprieve from overwhelming fears and societal stigma. The culture fostered within House music clubs provided a space where individuals could come together, share their experiences, and create a sense of solidarity. Consequently, many vocalists and producers within the genre openly expressed their sexuality, fostering representation at a time when mainstream media largely neglected LGBTQ+ narratives.

As House music garnered recognition beyond its local roots, it evolved into a cultural phenomenon that transcended geographical boundaries. The United Kingdom, in particular, embraced House music, transforming it into a cornerstone of the rave and underground club scene in the late '80s and early '90s. British raves not only celebrated a love for the music but also contributed to a sense of community and unity—creating an experience that connected listeners at a visceral level.

In contemporary society, House music continues to play an essential role in cultural dynamics, adapting to worldwide trends while remaining grounded in its core principles. Events such as music festivals, pride marches, and cultural celebrations often feature House music prominently, reaffirming its position as a voice for communal identity and acceptance. The genre serves as a backdrop for moments of joy, resilience, and empowerment.

Moreover, House music's influence is apparent in fashion, visual art, and various creative expressions. The aesthetic surrounding House culture often incorporates elements of bold colors, abstract imagery, and an emphasis on inclusivity. DJ culture, both in mixing and producing, has permeated popular media and has inspired countless artists across genres to embrace the high-energy essence of House music.

House music has also entered the realm of popular music, with numerous mainstream artists integrating its rhythmic structures and sound design into their work. Tracks that chart successfully often borrow from House's infectious beats, further embedding the genre into contemporary culture. The crossover appeal of House music speaks to its continuing relevance, adapting to new influences while retaining its spirit.

In sum, the cultural significance of House music is multifaceted, reflecting broader societal conversations while fostering inclusivity and community connection. As we navigate through its performance and live culture in the following section, we can see how House music continues to gather people together, creating transformative experiences on the dancefloor and beyond.


## Performance and Live Culture


The performance and live culture of House music are intricately linked to its identity and communal experience, crafting environments where individuals can come together to share in the joy of music and dance. From intimate underground clubs to massive outdoor festivals, the settings in which House music is presented help shape the collective experience of its audience. The rise of DJ culture, in tandem with live performances and events, has created a dynamic ecosystem that celebrates both the artistry and energy synonymous with House music.

DJs have long been considered the backbone of House music performance culture. Unlike traditional performance formats where artists play live instruments, DJs create their sets by mixing tracks, using their skills to elicit energy and emotion from the audience. This emphasis on curation turns each performance into a unique experience, where the DJ acts as both conductor and curator, weaving together various musical elements to craft a world that invites audiences to lose themselves on the dancefloor.

Clubs and music venues have traditionally provided the primary space for House music performances. These locales, often dimly lit and adorned with pulsating lights and visuals, create an immersive atmosphere designed to engage the senses. Notable nightclubs such as the Paradise Garage in New York and the Warehouse in Chicago are iconic in the history of House, serving as melting pots for diverse communities while setting the tone for the genre's evolution.

The connection between DJ and audience is further deepened by the role of the sound system. High-quality sound systems are essential in House music performance, allowing for the full range of frequencies—essential for experiencing the depth of synths, basslines, and rhythmic elements. The physicality of House music resonates at a visceral level, encouraging audiences to engage with the music physically through dance. This kinesthetic element becomes a communal experience, uniting people on the dancefloor in shared expression.

In addition to traditional club performances, festivals have become a vital part of House music's live culture, captivating massive audiences and showcasing a roster of talent. Events such as the Tomorrowland and Ultra Music Festival have turned into global gatherings, where attendees celebrate House music and its vibrant culture. The festival atmosphere allows for collaboration and innovation, as many artists perform their tracks alongside one another, creating unique sets that blend various subgenres.

Moreover, the integration of visual art and technology has transcended conventional performance practices within the realm of House music. The use of elaborate light shows, visual projections, and immersive stage designs enhances the audience's experience, transforming live performances into captivating multisensory events. Some artists use visual elements to directly interact with the music, creating immersive environments that deepen the listener’s emotional experience through the interplay of sights and sounds.

Furthermore, House music has evolved to include live instrumentation in performances, creating a hybrid experience that captivates audiences. Artists such as Hot Since 82 and the Jazzanova collective incorporate live instruments—such as drums, keyboards, and saxophones—into their sets, producing a rich, layered sound that merges the organic with the electronic. This approach not only contributes to the texture of the performance but also allows for improvisation, cultivating an atmosphere of spontaneity and excitement.

The House culture also emphasizes the importance of community and social engagement. Events often become platforms for activism, celebrating diversity and inclusion while challenging societal norms. Key instances such as Pride celebrations and charitable events see House music uniting audiences under common values. Beyond just music, these occasions foster a sense of belonging, as attendees unite to champion social causes and advocate for change.

In conclusion, the performance and live culture of House music create an immersive experience that extends beyond mere entertainment; it embodies a spirit of unity, inclusivity, and celebration. These settings serve as crucial venues for community interaction and emotional resonance, deeply interwoven with the genre's very fabric. As we examine the development and evolution of House music in the next section, we can appreciate how this performance culture continues to shape its trajectory while responding to a changing world.


## Development and Evolution


House music's evolution has been marked by continuous transformation, closely intertwined with cultural developments, emerging technologies, and shifting societal dynamics. From its origins in Chicago's underground scene to its global prominence today, House music has undergone phases, incorporating new influences and redefining its identity throughout the years.

Initially birthed in the clubs of Chicago in the early 1980s, House music developed as a response to the commercialism that pervaded the disco era. DJs and producers began experimenting with elements like repetition, looping, and a four-on-the-floor beat, creating a sound that celebrated free expression and collective connection. The genre's formative years saw artists draw inspiration from disco, funk, and soul, establishing a sonic foundation that would reverberate throughout its history.

As House music expanded beyond Chicago in the mid-1980s, it encountered diverse musical influences that enriched its development. The arrival of Acid House, characterized by squelchy basslines from the Roland TB-303, exemplifies this progression. Emerging in the UK, Acid House adapted House's rhythmic structures while pushing sonic boundaries, laying the groundwork for the rave culture that flourished in the late '80s. This crossover highlighted the genre's adaptability, engaging broader audiences and fostering a sense of communal experience.

The early 1990s saw the emergence of subgenres like Deep House and Progressive House, which explored different expressions within the House framework. These variations showcased a more melodic approach and emphasized emotional resonance, allowing producers to communicate deeper narratives. The rise of iconic labels such as Strictly Rhythm and Def Mix played a pivotal role in the dissemination of varied House sounds, facilitating collaborations and remix culture that further accelerated the evolution of the genre.

In the following decade, the advent of technology reshaped House music, allowing for unprecedented access to production tools. The introduction of digital audio workstations (DAWs) revolutionized the music-making landscape, democratizing production and enabling aspiring artists to create high-quality tracks from their own homes. This accessibility introduced a diverse array of voices and sparked further experimentation within the genre. The proliferation of online platforms also facilitated the sharing and distribution of music, creating a vast network of emerging artists and audiences who relied on digital channels to connect.

As the 2000s progressed, House music began to integrate elements from various genres. The fusion of House and hip-hop, exemplified by producers like Armand Van Helden and Diplo, showcased a new direction that resonated with younger audiences. Additionally, the rise of EDM festivals in the 2010s introduced House music to massive crowds and encapsulated the energy of live events. It not only broadened the genre’s reach but also inspired collaboration with mainstream artists, leading to culturally significant performances at prominent festivals like Coachella and Ultra Music Festival.

The development of House music has also instigated a dialogue surrounding commitment to cultural roots. As the genre became more commercialized, artists and purists alike sought to maintain its foundational ethos while exploring diverse sounds and styles. Contemporary artists, such as Black Coffee and Peggy Gou, have garnered attention for blending contemporary aesthetics with traditional elements, exemplifying the ongoing quest for balance between innovation and honoring the genre's history.

Furthermore, regional variations of House music, such as Afro House and Latin House, have gained recognition on the international stage, illustrating how local sounds can infuse the genre with fresh energy while reflecting distinct cultural narratives. The ability of House music to embrace these regional divergences signifies its commitment to diversity, further enhancing the genre’s richness and relevance in a multicultural society.

In sum, the development and evolution of House music portray a dynamic interplay of cultural influences, advancements in technology, and ongoing dialogues about identity and representation. As the genre continues to evolve, each phase reveals a new layer in the intricate tapestry that is House music, reflecting a broader societal narrative. This ongoing evolution contributes to House music’s continued relevance, carrying forward its legacy into the future, which we will examine in the final section focusing on the legacy and influence of House music.
