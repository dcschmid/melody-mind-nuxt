## Political and Social Background

The 1990s emerged as a decade of profound political and social transformation, significantly influencing the development of popular music. The fall of the Berlin Wall in late 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked the end of the Cold War, creating a new global political landscape that would shape cultural expression throughout the decade.

This period witnessed the acceleration of globalization, facilitated by rapid technological advancement and increasing economic interconnectedness. The rise of the internet, though still in its early stages, began to transform how people communicated and accessed information.
